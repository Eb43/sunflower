  The Sunflower app is an application that displays an animated sunflower on the screen. The sunflower's petals, leaves, and stem undergo smooth transitions, creating a dynamic and aesthetically pleasing effect. Additionally, the supportive text is shown. 
  
  The animation runs in a loop when user presses the button.

  The app does not simply display a premade GIF animation file as in the [GifandVideoPlaying](https://github.com/Eb43/GifandVideoPlaying/blob/main/README.md) app. The Sunflower app animates static images of the sunflower parts using math functions.
